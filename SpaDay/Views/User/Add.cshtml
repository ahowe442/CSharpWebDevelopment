@*  TODO:   Within the Add.cshtml template, create a form that accepts inputs for each of the User class properties.
    Include an additional password input field to verify the password input. The form should be set up to POST to /user.

    Be sure to set type="password" for the password and verify inputs, to ensure the passwords are not visible when
    being typed into the form. You can also set type="email" on the email input, which will enable some basic
    client-side validation. We’ll tackle validation in more detail in the next lesson.
