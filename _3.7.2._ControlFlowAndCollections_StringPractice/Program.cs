            Use the Split method to divide the string at each space and store the individual words in an array. If you need to review the method syntax, look back at the string methods table.

            //Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", arrayName));

            //Repeat steps 2 and 3, but change the delimiter to split the string into separate sentences.
