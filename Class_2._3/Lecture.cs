                        // protected - can be access in the same class or any sub-classes
                        // internal - this is the DEFAULT for classes, the type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
                        // NOTE: When we say assembly we mean project/solution/library.
                        // protected internal - The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or sub-classes (He's yet to see this in production)

                        // We can have more than one constructor for a given class as long as they have different
                        // method signatures.

                        // Student has muiltiple overloaded constructors

                        // A method is a function that belongs to a class. In C#, all procedures must be part of a class.

                        // 4.5.1 Calling Methods on Objects
                        // Referring back to our Helloworld example
            HelloWorld hw = new HelloWorld();       // Instaiate an instance of the HelloWorld class
            hw.SayHello();                          // Calling the method SayHello on the object hw which is an instance of the HelloWorld class

                        /*
		                 * The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should
		                 * have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the
		                 * software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the
		                 * class.

                        // and one thing only!

                        // If you're mixing and matching code, you should probably break them up into
                        // two classes.
