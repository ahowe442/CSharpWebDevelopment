# RestaurantMenu

To review, here are the details you have from the restaurant owner:

1.  The menu consists of several menu items.
2.  Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert).
3.  It should be possible to display whether or not a menu item is new.
4.  The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items.

### Based on these details, you need to include some instance methods:


1.  A way to add and remove menu items from the menu.
2.  A way to tell if a menu item is new.
3.  A way to tell when the menu was last updated.
4.  A way to print out both a single menu item as well as the entire menu.
5.  A way to determine whether or not two menu items are equal.
